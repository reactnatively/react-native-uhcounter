# React Natively

## UhCounter

We're creating a simple app to allow iOS &amp; Android users the ability to count how many times they here the word "Uh" or "Um".
* The app would simply tally the amount of these filler words they heard and tap a simple "Um" button.
* The button would then send their latitude, longitude, user ID and a text string to an API we'll provide.

_PLEASE NOTE: It is important that this app be developed with React Native because we want to deploy to our student group for testing on either iOS or Android devices._
