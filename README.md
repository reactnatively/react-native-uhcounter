# react-uhcounter
We're creating a simple app to allow iOS &amp; Android users the ability to count how many times they here the word "Uh" or "Um". The app would simply tally the amount of these filler words they heard and tap a simple "Um" button. The button would then send their latitude, longitude, user ID and a text string to an API we'll provide.
